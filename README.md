# Budget-App



## Description

> The Ruby on Rails capstone project ([remember what they are?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/capstone_intro.md)) is about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.

- I created a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:

  - register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
  - introduce new transactions associated with a category.
  - see the money spent on each category.
